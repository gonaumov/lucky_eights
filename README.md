# Lucky eights

This is just a simple play with CSS 3 animation. In some cultures, the number 8 is considered extremely lucky. This is de facto just a site that shows a lot of eights one after the other. They spawn in the container every second and start moving in a random direction and at a random distance. It is a old retired project - a jQuery plugin for random movind something in a container. You can see it live [here](https://gonaumov.github.io/lucky_eights/).
